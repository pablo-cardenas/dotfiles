                 in many practical applications and are challenging to

                 computers are reported but are accessible only to a
                 few. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) of today have
                 high computation power and low price. They have a
                 restrictive programming model and are tricky to use.
                 The G80 line of Nvidia GPUs can be treated as a SIMD
                 processor array using the CUDA programming model. We
                 present a few fundamental algorithms -- including
                 breadth first search, single source shortest path, and
                 all-pairs shortest path -- using CUDA on large graphs.
                 We can compute the single source shortest path on a 10
                 million vertex graph in 1.5 seconds using the Nvidia
                 8800GTX GPU costing {\$}600. In some cases optimal
                 sequential algorithm is not the fastest on the GPU
                 architecture. GPUs have great potential as
                 high-performance co-processors.",

                 for congested networks, that captures demands, costs,
                 flows, and behavior. The network efficiency/performance
                 measure can identify which network components, that is,
                 nodes and links, have the greatest impact in terms of
                 their removal, due to, for example, natural disasters,
                 structural failures, terrorist attacks, etc., and,
                 hence, are important from both vulnerability as well as
                 security standpoints. The new measure is applied to the
                 Braess paradox network in which the demands are varied
                 over the horizon and explicit formulae are derived for
                 the importance values of the network nodes and links.
                 This measure is applicable to such congested networks
                 as urban transportation networks and the Internet.",

                 problem in a setting where preprocessing is allowed. We
                 improve the reach-based approach of Gutman [17] in
                 several ways. In particular, we introduce a
                 bidirectional version of the algorithm that uses
                 implicit lower bounds and we add shortcut arcs to
                 reduce vertex reaches. Our modifications greatly
                 improve both preprocessing and query times. The
                 resulting algorithm is as fast as the best previous
                 method, due to Sanders and Schultes [28]. However, our
                 algorithm is simpler and combines in a natural way with
                 A* search, which yields significantly better query
                 times.",

  abstract =     "We present a novel algorithm to solve the non-negative
                 single-source shortest path problem on road networks
                 and graphs with low highway dimension. After a quick
                 preprocessing phase, we can compute all distances from
                 a given source in the graph with essentially a linear
                 sweep over all vertices. Because this sweep is
                 independent of the source, we are able to reorder
                 vertices in advance to exploit locality. Moreover, our
                 algorithm takes advantage of features of modern CPU
                 architectures, such as SSE and multiple cores. Compared
                 to Dijkstra’s algorithm, our method needs fewer
                 operations, has better locality, and is better able to
                 exploit parallelism at multi-core and instruction
                 levels. We gain additional speedup when implementing
                 our algorithm on a GPU, where it is up to three orders
                 of magnitude faster than Dijkstra’s algorithm on a
                 high-end CPU. This makes applications based on
                 all-pairs shortest-paths practical for
                 continental-sized road networks. Several algorithms,
                 such as computing the graph diameter, arc flags, or
                 exact reaches, can be greatly accelerated by our
                 method.",
