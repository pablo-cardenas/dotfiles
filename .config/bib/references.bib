                 in many practical applications and are challenging to
                 process. Practical-time implementations using high-end
                 computers are reported but are accessible only to a
                 few. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) of today have
                 high computation power and low price. They have a
                 restrictive programming model and are tricky to use.
                 The G80 line of Nvidia GPUs can be treated as a SIMD
                 processor array using the CUDA programming model. We
                 present a few fundamental algorithms -- including
                 breadth first search, single source shortest path, and
                 all-pairs shortest path -- using CUDA on large graphs.
                 We can compute the single source shortest path on a 10
                 million vertex graph in 1.5 seconds using the Nvidia
                 8800GTX GPU costing {\$}600. In some cases optimal
                 sequential algorithm is not the fastest on the GPU
                 architecture. GPUs have great potential as
                 high-performance co-processors.",
